Got it. Here are the **features to implement** — no code, just clear requirements:

---

### ✅ Feature Requirements for Dev: Thank You Page Course Alert

1. **Settings Page in Admin**

   * Add a new settings page under LearnDash or in the plugin menu.
   * Title: **“Thank You Page Settings”**
   * Function: Allow admin to configure Thank You page behavior.

2. **Course Selection Checkbox List**

   * Show a list of all LearnDash courses with checkboxes.
   * Admin can **select one or more courses**.
   * These selections determine **which courses trigger the alert** on the Thank You page.

3. **Store Selected Courses in Options**

   * Save selected course IDs as a single option (`lilac_thank_you_courses` or similar).
   * This data should persist across admin visits.

4. **Trigger Alert on Thank You Page**

   * On the WooCommerce Thank You page:

     * If the order includes a course that matches a selected course from the settings,
     * Show a **success-style alert** to the user.

5. **Flexible Compatibility**

   * Make sure this works with existing logic:

     * Courses related to WooCommerce products (via post meta or other mapping).
     * Works whether or not delayed activation is on.

6. **Optional UI/UX**

   * The alert should be styled to clearly show success.
   * Avoid conflicts with existing WooCommerce messages.
