# Course Access Control System

## Overview
This system manages course access based on user purchases and roles. It ensures that users only have access to the courses they've purchased and are assigned to the correct user groups.

## Key Features

1. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Maps products to specific user roles
   - Automatically assigns users to appropriate groups
   - Manages course access expiration

2. **Integration**
   - Works with WooCommerce purchases
   - Integrates with LearnDash LMS
   - Supports both individual and group enrollments

## Configuration

### 1. Product to Role Mapping
Edit the `$product_role_mapping` array in `includes/course-access.php` to map product IDs to user roles:

```php
private $product_role_mapping = [
    '3990' => 'student_private',  // מנוי תרגול לאתר
    // Add more mappings as needed
];
```

### 2. Course Assignment
Update the `get_courses_for_role` method to assign courses to each role:

```php
private function get_courses_for_role($role) {
    $role_courses = [
        'student_private' => [123],  // Course IDs for private students
        'student_school' => [456],   // Course IDs for school students
        'school_teacher' => [789]    // Course IDs for teachers
    ];
    
    return $role_courses[$role] ?? [];
}
```

### 3. Group Assignment
Update the `get_group_for_role` method to map roles to LearnDash group IDs:

```php
private function get_group_for_role($role) {
    $role_groups = [
        'student_private' => 1,  // Group ID for private students
        'student_school' => 2,   // Group ID for school students
        'school_teacher' => 3    // Group ID for teachers
    ];
    
    return $role_groups[$role] ?? 0;
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Purchase Completion**
   - When an order is marked as completed, the system checks the purchased products
   - Maps the product to a user role
   - Grants access to the corresponding courses
   - Assigns the user to the appropriate group

2. **Access Control**
   - Checks if the user has access to a course
   - Validates access expiration
   - Manages course enrollment

3. **Group Management**
   - Automatically adds users to groups based on their role
   - Handles group assignments during course enrollment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Access After Purchase**
   - Verify the order status is marked as "Completed"
   - Check the product ID in the mapping
   - Ensure the course IDs are correct

2. **Wrong Group Assignment**
   - Verify the group IDs in `get_group_for_role`
   - Check if the groups exist in LearnDash

3. **Access Expiration**
   - The default access duration is 365 days
   - Update `$access_duration` to change this

## Maintenance

### Adding New Products
1. Add the product to WooCommerce
2. Update the `$product_role_mapping` array
3. Assign courses to the role in `get_courses_for_role`
4. Update group assignments if needed

### Modifying Access
- To extend access, update the user's `lilac_course_access` meta
- To revoke access, remove the user from the LearnDash group and course

## Security
- All access checks are verified server-side
- User roles and capabilities are properly managed
- Access expiration is strictly enforced
