1. WooCommerce Customizations Class
Created a new file at includes/woocommerce/class-woocommerce-customizations.php that handles:

Shipping Field Management:
Hides shipping fields for virtual/downloadable products
Shows shipping fields only for physical products
Prevents mixing of physical and virtual products in cart
Custom Checkout Fields (for virtual products):
Phone number confirmation
ID number field (for student registration)
Proper validation for all fields
Cart Validation:
Prevents adding physical products to a cart with virtual products and vice versa
Validates ID number format (9 digits)
Validates phone number confirmation
2. Integration with Theme
Updated functions.php to:

Load the WooCommerce customizations only when WooCommerce is active
Maintain existing functionality while adding new features
How It Works
For Virtual/Downloadable Products:
Removes shipping fields
Adds custom registration fields
Skips shipping calculation
For Physical Products:
Shows all shipping fields
No changes to standard WooCommerce behavior
Cart Validation:
Prevents mixing product types
Shows clear error messages
Testing
To test this implementation:

Virtual Product Checkout:
Add a virtual product to cart
Go to checkout
Verify shipping fields are hidden
Verify custom fields are shown
Test validation (ID number format, phone confirmation)
Physical Product Checkout:
Add a physical product to cart
Verify shipping fields are shown
Verify standard WooCommerce behavior
Mixed Cart Prevention:
Try adding both product types to cart
Verify appropriate error message is shown
Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation or would you like to test it first?
