🧠 Role Mapping – lilac student flow
📋 Role Definitions
name	display_name
student_private	תלמיד עצמאי
student_school	תלמיד חינוך תעבורתי
school_teacher	מורה / רכז

🧱 Integration Notes
Central config file:
Store this in: settings.roles.json


{
  "roles": {
    "student_private": "תלמיד עצמאי",
    "student_school": "תלמיד חינוך תעבורתי",
    "school_teacher": "מורה / רכז"
  }
}
Code access pattern:
Define a helper class to manage roles:


// SUGGESTION
        class RoleRegistry {
            public static function getAll(): array {
                return json_decode(file_get_contents(__DIR__ . '/../settings.roles.json'), true)['roles'] ?? [];
            }

            public static function getDisplayName(string $role): ?string {
                $roles = self::getAll();
                return $roles[$role] ?? null;
            }
        }
Usage in dev tasks:

Add role info to Linked Components section of task files if relevant.

When altering logic for roles, include "Roles Affected" in the fix doc.

## 🧾 Task: Purchase Flow with Custom Registration Form (10th Grade Student – School Plan)

### 🎯 Goal

Allow a student to purchase access to the program only after completing a custom registration form that collects required school-related details.

---

### ✅ Flow Overview

1. **User clicks “Purchase Now”**

   * Instead of going to cart or checkout, the user is redirected to a **custom signup form page**.

2. **User fills out the registration form**

   * The form collects:

     * First name
     * Last name
     * Phone number
     * Email
     * ID number
     * School name
     * School code
     * Teacher name
     * Class number
     * Promo code (optional)

3. **User submits the form**

   * Upon submission, the system:

     * Creates a user account using the provided phone and ID
     * Stores the submitted data

4. **User is redirected to payment**

   * The user is taken to a predefined payment page that contains the correct product (e.g., `/checkout/?add-to-cart=123`)

5. **After successful payment**

   * The system continues with post-purchase actions:

     * Confirms user enrollment in the correct course (e.g., “School Theory”)
     * Sets subscription expiry (e.g., June 30)
     * Sends confirmation (email/SMS)

---

### 📌 Notes

* The registration step **must happen before payment**
* The student should not use the default WooCommerce registration/checkout
* Each user’s access and data should be unique and linked to their school identity
* No cart flow, bundles, or variable product selection should be visible to the student
